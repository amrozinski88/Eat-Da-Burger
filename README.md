# Eat-Da-Burger-
* Burger app

* Hosted heroku link https://git.heroku.com/burger-eater-ucf.git

* This is an app created to demonstrate handlebars and mysql mainly.

* You can click one of the premade burgers to eat it.
    You can also add a new burger by typing the name.
* Once you submit your burger it reaches out to the databse to insert  it and           handlebars creates it dynamically from the new table item.
* Handlebars is used to generate a <li> for each burger in the database,
it also generates <li>s for the burgers that have been eaten on the right.
